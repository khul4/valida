By showing different variants (A and B) to segments of your audience, marketers can gather valuable data on user preferences and behaviors. This approach helps optimize conversion rates and make data-driven decisions that improve overall campaign effectiveness."

        content: "In A/B testing, two versions of the same element—such as a call-to-action button, headline, or image—are created. Version A could be the original (control), while version B contains a change (variation). The audience is randomly split into groups, each exposed to one version. Metrics such as click-through rates, conversions, or time spent on page are tracked to identify the winning design or content."
