# A/B Testing

**Term:** A/B Testing (also known as Split Testing)

**Definition:**

A/B testing is a digital marketing experiment where two or more variations of a webpage, email, ad, or other marketing asset are shown to different segments of an audience at the same time. The goal is to compare performance and determine which version drives better results based on predefined metrics (e.g., clicks, conversions, engagement).

**Key Components:**

- **Variant A (Control):** The original version of the asset.
- **Variant B (Challenger):** The modified version with one or more changes (e.g., button color, headline, layout).
- **Audience Split:** Traffic or audience is randomly divided between the variants to ensure fairness.
- **Metrics (KPIs):** Success is measured by key performance indicators such as click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, sign-ups, or revenue.
- **Statistical Significance:** Ensures results are reliable and not due to chance.

**Examples in Digital Marketing:**

- Changing the text on a **CTA button** ("Buy Now" vs. "Shop Today").
- Testing **email subject lines** to see which generates higher open rates.
- Comparing two **landing page designs** to maximize lead generation.
- Running different **ad creatives** to find the most engaging format.

**Benefits:**

- Provides data-driven insights rather than relying on assumptions.
- Improves conversion rates and ROI.
- Reduces risks by testing changes before full rollout.
- Enhances customer experience by aligning with audience preferences.

**Best Practices:**

- Test **one variable at a time** for clarity of results.
- Ensure **enough sample size** for statistical validity.
- Define clear **hypotheses** before running the test.
- Run tests long enough to account for **user behavior patterns**.
- Use reliable **A/B testing tools** (e.g., Google Optimize, Optimizely, VWO).
